## Automated dependency updates

This asks GitHub to run
["dependabot"](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot)
periodically over the repo code base.
Dependabot is a key tool to ensure that your code dependencies are up to date,
especially for security concerns.

Dependabot will file PRs for your project when it finds updates, and suggest
how to update your package files.

See [`.github/dependabot.yml`] to configure.
Presently it is set to check daily.
